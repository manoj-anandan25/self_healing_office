###  Overview
The **Self-Healing Office** is an intelligent automation system that uses Computer Vision to monitor workspace health and occupancy. By detecting presence and environmental changes, the system autonomously manages resources to ensure an optimized, "self-healing" workspace.

###  Key Features
- [x] **Presence Detection:** Real-time monitoring using OpenCV Haar Cascades.
- [x] **Smart Resource Allocation:** Dynamically adjusts lighting/HVAC based on occupancy.
- [x] **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies irregular patterns in office usage.
- [x] **Automated Logging:** Saves daily occupancy data for workspace analytics.
